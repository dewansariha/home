			<h2>About This Site</h2>
			<p>Everyone loves to hear a good pun every now and then. But what is a pun exactly? A good way to define a pun is to say it is a play 
			on words, where two words that either sound the same or are spelled the same but have different meanings are used in a humorous way.<p>
			<p>Puns can be used in everyday life to cheer or impress someone and can be used in multiple situations. And so if you are ever in a 
			situation where you need a pun- FAST; this is the site to come to.</p>
		</div>
		<!--- For each different type of pun, there is a side column on the definition and the main column with the puns -->
